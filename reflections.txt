You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

New skills I have learned:
*I learned how to use <br>(which only works in between texts) and <s> (which strikethrough words and sentence)
*I learned that instead of putting space in between paragraphs (by double-space), you can instead use <p></p> which puts spacing in between each paragraph.

What has been easy
*adding images
* adding hyperlinks
* using <h1> <h2> <p> <em>

What has been difficult
* Changing links from Markdown into the <a href=“”></a> which was very difficult at first
* Using <figure> and <figcaption> which I’m still confused about how to use it properly

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
*When I was stuck I would either take a break to think my problem through or research (using MDN) to learn about each element and how to use it properly.
